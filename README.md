# Sentinel Ninja 🥷

A collection of tools and documentation for Microsoft Sentinel practitioners.

## About Me

Hi, I'm **Ofer Shezaf** – an InfoSec professional with extensive experience in security research, product definition, and customer-facing activities. I've been working in this field since before "InfoSec" became "Cyber"!

I believe that creating security products requires a unique blend of technology, customer requirements, security expertise, and understanding customer perception of risk. Throughout my career, I've focused on the junction of these disciplines to create security solutions that effectively reduce both real and perceived cyber risk.

Currently, I'm a **Principal Product Manager** working on **Microsoft Sentinel** at Microsoft.
