# RiskIQ-Data-PassiveDns-Ip

This playbook uses the RiskIQ PassiveTotal connector to automatically enrich incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel. Passive DNS provides analysts with a means to see DNS data in a historic manner. This history can aid in creating analytical connections, especially if the operational security of a threat actor is poor. Leverage this playbook in order to enrich your incidents with raw passive DNS data related to indicators found within the incident.
