# Rename System Utilities

Attackers often use LOLBINs that are renamed to avoid detection rules that are based on filenames. This rule detects renamed LOLBINs by first searching for all the known SHA1 hashes of the LOLBINs in your DeviceProcessEvents. This list is then used as reference to find other files executed which have a name that doesn't match the original filename.  This query is really heavy on resources. Use it with care.
