# Anomalous Geo Location Logon

Adversaries may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using credential access techniques or capture credentials earlier in their reconnaissance process through social engineering as a means of gaining initial access. APT33, for example, has used valid accounts for initial access. The query below generates an output of a successful sign-in performed by a user from a new geolocation he has never connected to before and none of his peers as well.
