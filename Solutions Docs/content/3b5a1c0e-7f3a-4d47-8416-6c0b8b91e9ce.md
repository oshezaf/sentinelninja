# CYFIRMA - Attack Surface - Weak Certificate Exposure - High Rule

This alert indicates that a weak or insecure SSL/TLS certificate has been detected on a public-facing asset monitored by Cyfirma.  Such certificates do not meet modern encryption standards and are considered insecure, especially for handling sensitive transactions.  This exposure increases the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and loss of data integrity or confidentiality.  Immediate remediation is advised by replacing weak certificates with strong, industry-compliant ones.
