# Hijack Execution Flow - DLL Side-Loading

This detection tries to identify all DLLs loaded by "high integrity" processes and cross-checks the DLL paths against FileCreate/FileModify events of the same DLL by a medium integrity process. Of course, we need to do some magic to filter out false positives as much as possible. So any FileCreate/FileModify done by "NT Authoriy\System" and the "RID 500" users aren't interesting. Also, we only want to see the FileCreate/FileModify actions which are performed with a default or limited token eleva
