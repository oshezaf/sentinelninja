# Block IP - Azure Firewall IP groups - Entity trigger

This playbook interacts with relevant stackholders, such incident response team, to approve blocking/allowing IPs in Azure Firewall. Playbook also involves TI statistics from VirusTotal. It allows to make changes on IP groups, which are attached to rules, instead of make direct changes on Azure Firewall. It also allows using the same IP group for multiple firewalls.
