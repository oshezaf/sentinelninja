# RiskIQ-Base

This playbook creates a shared API Connection for all RiskIQ playbooks to leverage. This eases the configuration process for a user during deployment of the RiskIQ solution. In time, this base playbook may be extended to set more functionality. You will need your API credentials (email/secret) when configuring this playbook. Those can be found on your [account settings](https://community.riskiq.com/settings) page. For enterprise customers, it's preferred to use the 'organization' credential pair
