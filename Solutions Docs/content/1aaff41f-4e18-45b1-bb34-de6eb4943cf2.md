# Component Object Model Hijacking - Vault7 trick

This detection looks for the very specific value of "Attribute" in the "ShellFolder" CLSID of a COM object. This value (0xf090013d) seems to only link back to this specific persistence method.  The blog post linked here (https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-execution/forcing-iexplore.exe-to-load-a-malicious-dll-via-com-abuse) provides more background on the meaning of this value.
