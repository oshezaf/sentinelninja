# Azure Portal sign in from another Azure Tenant

This query looks for successful sign in attempts to the Azure Portal where the user who is signing in from another Azure tenant, and the IP address the login attempt is from is an Azure IP. A threat actor who compromises an Azure tenant may look to pivot to other tenants leveraging cross-tenant delegated access in this manner.
