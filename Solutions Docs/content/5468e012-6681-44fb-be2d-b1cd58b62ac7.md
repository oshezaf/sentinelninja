# CYFIRMA - Medium severity Malicious Phishing Network Indicators - Block Recommended Rule

"This analytics rule identifies network indicators such as URLs, IP addresses, and domains related to phishing campaigns, as reported by CYFIRMA threat intelligence.  These indicators are flagged with a recommended action to block and are categorized under the 'Phishing' role. Such infrastructure is often used to deliver phishing emails, host fake login portals, or redirect victims to credential-harvesting pages.  Blocking these indicators proactively helps prevent user compromise and data theft
