# Azure DevOps Pipeline Created and Deleted on the Same Day

An attacker with access to Azure DevOps could create a pipeline to inject artifacts used by other pipelines, or to create a malicious software build that looks legitimate by using a pipeline that incorporates legitimate elements.  An attacker would also likely want to cover their tracks once conducting such activity. This query looks for Pipelines created and deleted within the same day, this is unlikely to be legitimate user activity in the majority of cases.
