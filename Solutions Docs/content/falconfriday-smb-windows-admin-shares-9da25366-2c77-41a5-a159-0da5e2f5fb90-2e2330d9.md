# SMB/Windows Admin Shares

This query is based on detecting incoming RPC/TCP on the SCM, followed by the start of a child process of services.exe. Remotely interacting with the SCM triggers the RPC/TCP traffic on services.exe, and the creation of the child processes is a result of starting the service.  The query might look intimidating given its size. That's why we've commented the query per logic block to walk you through the details.
