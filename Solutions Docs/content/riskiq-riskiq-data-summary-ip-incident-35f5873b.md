# RiskIQ-Data-Summary-Ip-Incident

This playbook uses the RiskIQ PassiveTotal connector to automatically enrich incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel. The RiskIQ summary data will provide analysts with an understanding of what RiskIQ knows about a given indicator extracted from the incident in the form of result counts with corresponding data sets. Each data set will be linked, making it easy for an analyst to one-click pivot into a deeper investigation.
