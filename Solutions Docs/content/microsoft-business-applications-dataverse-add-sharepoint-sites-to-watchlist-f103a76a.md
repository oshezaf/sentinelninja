# Dataverse: Add SharePoint sites to watchlist

This playbook is used to add new or updated SharePoint document management sites into the configuration watchlist. When combined with a scheduled analytics rule monitoring the Dataverse activity log, this Playbook will trigger when a new SharePoint document management site mapping is added. The site will be added to a watchlist to extend monitoring coverage.
