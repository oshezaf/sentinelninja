# First access credential added to Application or Service Principal where no credential was present

'This will alert when an admin or app owner account adds a new credential to an Application or Service Principal where there was no previous verify KeyCredential associated. If a threat actor obtains access to an account with sufficient privileges and adds the alternate authentication material triggering this event, the threat actor can now authenticate as the Application or Service Principal using this credential. Additional information on OAuth Credential Grants can be found in RFC 6749 Sectio
