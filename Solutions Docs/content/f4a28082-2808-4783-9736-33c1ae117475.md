# High-Risk Cross-Cloud User Impersonation

This detection focuses on identifying high-risk cross-cloud activities and sign-in anomalies that may indicate potential security threats. The query starts by analyzing Microsoft Entra ID Signin Logs to pinpoint instances where specific applications, risk levels, and result types align. It then correlates this information with relevant AWS CloudTrail events to identify activities across Azure and AWS environments.
