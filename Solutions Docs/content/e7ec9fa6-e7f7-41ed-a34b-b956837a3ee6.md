# Failed logon attempts in authpriv

Identifies failed logon attempts from unknown users in Syslog authpriv logs. The unknown user means the account that tried to log in isn't provisioned on the machine. A few hits could indicate someone attempting to access a machine they aren't authorized to access.  If there are many of hits, especially from outside your network, it could indicate a brute force attack.  Default threshold for logon attempts is 15.
