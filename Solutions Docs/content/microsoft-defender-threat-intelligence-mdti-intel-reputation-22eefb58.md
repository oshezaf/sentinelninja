This playbook uses the MDTI API to automatically enrich incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel. Reputation information provides analyst with a decision as to whether an indicator is considered benign, suspicious or malicious. Analysts can leverage this playbook in order to enrich indicators found within an incident. Each reputation result is contained within a comment and will include detailed scoring information noting why a given indicator is considered suspicious or malicious with links ba

## Overview
This playbook uses the [Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/what-is-microsoft-defender-threat-intelligence-defender-ti) Reputation Data to automatically enrich incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel. [Reputation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender/threat-intelligence/reputation-scoring) information provides analysts with a decision as to whether an indicator is considered benign, suspicious, or malicious. Analysts can leverage this playbook to enrich indicators found within an incident. Each reputation result is contained within a comment and includes detailed scoring information noting why a given indicator is considered suspicious or malicious, with links back to the MDTI platform for more information.

## Key Capabilities
- Automatically triggers on new Sentinel incidents (incident creation trigger).
- Collects Host and IP entities (up to the limits of the incident payload).
- Queries MDTI Reputation data via Microsoft Graph (Managed Identity auth).
- Generates per-host and per-IP HTML tables summarizing reputation observations.
- Adds structured comments back to the originating incident.

## Prerequisites
1. Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (MDTI) Premium license enabled for the tenant. If you have trouble accessing your account or your credentials, contact your account representative (mdtidiscussion[@]microsoft.com).
2. One of the following Azure AD roles (to grant Graph application permissions to the playbook's Managed Identity): Security Administrator, Global Administrator, or Privileged Role Administrator.

## Post-Deployment Steps

### 1. Assign Microsoft Graph Permission (ThreatIntelligence.Read.All) to Managed Identity
To allow the playbook to query Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence data, you must grant the managed identity of the playbook the `ThreatIntelligence.Read.All` application permission in Microsoft Graph. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary Azure AD permissions (Security Administrator, Global Administrator, or Privileged Role Administrator).
2. Open the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or use a local PowerShell session with the Microsoft Graph module installed.
3. Run the following commands, replacing `'MDTI-Intel-Reputation'` with your playbook's name if different:

```powershell
# Install the Microsoft Graph module for interacting with Microsoft Graph APIs
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber -Force
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph

# Authenticate to Microsoft Graph using Managed Identity
Connect-MgGraph -Identity

# Retrieve the Microsoft Graph Service Principal
$graphSp = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq 'Microsoft Graph'"

# Find the ThreatIntelligence.Read.All role
$role = $graphSp.AppRoles | Where-Object { $_.Value -eq 'ThreatIntelligence.Read.All' -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains 'Application' }

# Define the Logic App name (update if different)
$logicAppName = 'MDTI-Intel-Reputation'
$logicAppSp = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq '$logicAppName'"

# Assign the ThreatIntelligence.Read.All role to the Logic App's Managed Identity
New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalId $logicAppSp.Id `
    -PrincipalId $logicAppSp.Id `
    -ResourceId $graphSp.Id `
    -AppRoleId $role.Id

# Confirm the role assignment
Write-Host "Permission assigned successfully to Logic App ${logicAppName}."
```

### 2. Authorize Connections
After deployment, authorize all connections:

1. Click the Microsoft Sentinel connection resource.
