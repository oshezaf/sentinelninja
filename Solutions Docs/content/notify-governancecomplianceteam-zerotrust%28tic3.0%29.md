# Notify-GovernanceComplianceTeam

This Security Orchestration, Automation, & Response (SOAR) capability is designed for configuration with the solution's analytics rules. When analytics rules trigger this automation notifies the governance compliance team of respective details via Teams chat and exchange email. This automation reduces requirements to manually monitor the workbook or analytics rules while increasing response times.
