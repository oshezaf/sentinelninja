# SSH - Potential Brute Force

'Identifies an IP address that had 15 failed attempts to sign in via SSH in a 4 hour block during a 24 hour time period.  Please note that entity mapping for arrays is not supported, so when there is a single value in an array, we will pull that value from the array as a single string to populate the entity to support entity mapping features within Sentinel. Additionally, if the array is multivalued, we will input a string to indicate this with a unique hash so that matching will not occur.  As
