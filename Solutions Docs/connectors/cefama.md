## Additional Information

📖 **Related Documentation:** [CEF and CommonSecurityLog field mapping](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/cef-name-mapping) - Maps CEF field names to CommonSecurityLog column names

Common Event Format (CEF) is an industry standard format on top of Syslog messages, used by many security vendors to allow event interoperability among different platforms. By connecting your CEF logs to Microsoft Sentinel, you can take advantage of search & correlation, alerting, and threat intelligence enrichment for each log. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2223547&wt.mc_id=sentinel_dataconnectordocs_content_cnl_csasci).

## Tables Ingested

This connector ingests data into the following tables:

| Table | Supports Transformations | Ingestion API Supported |
|-------|:------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| [`CommonSecurityLog`](../tables/commonsecuritylog.md) | ✓ | ✓ |

> 💡 **Tip:** Tables with Ingestion API support allow data ingestion via the [Azure Monitor Data Collector API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-ingestion-api-overview), which also enables custom transformations during ingestion.
