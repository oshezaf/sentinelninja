# Anomalous High-Privileged Role Assignment

Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems. These actions include adding new accounts to high-privilege groups. Dragonfly 2.0, for example, added newly created accounts to the administrators group to maintain elevated access. The query below generates an output of all high-privilege users performing Add member to priveleged role, or where one or more features of the activity deviate from the user, his peers, or the tenant profile.
