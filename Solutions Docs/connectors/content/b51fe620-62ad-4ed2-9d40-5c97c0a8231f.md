# Suspicious AWS console logins by credential access alerts

This query aims to detect instances of successful AWS console logins that align with high-severity credential access or Initial Access alerts generated by Defender Products.  Specifically, it focuses on scenarios where the successful login takes place within a 60-minute timeframe of the high-severity alert. The login is considered relevant if it originates from an IP address associated with potential attackers.
